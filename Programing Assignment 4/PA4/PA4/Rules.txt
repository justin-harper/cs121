Yahtzee is a dice game that was invented by Milton Bradley and
Edwin S. Lowe in 1956. The challenge of the game is to outduel
the other player by scoring the most points.
Points are obtained by rolling five 6-sided die across thirteen
rounds. During each round, each player may roll the dice up to
three times to make one of the possible scoring combinations.
Once a combination has been achieved by the player, it may not 
be used again in future rounds, except for the Yahtzee
combination may be used as many times as the player
makes the combination. Each scoring combination has different
point totals. Some of these totals are achieved through the 
accumulation of points across rolls and some are obtained
as fixed sequences of values.
